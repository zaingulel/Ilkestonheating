## General info 


I was asked if I could create a website for my plumber, as the one he had was basic and didn't look as professional as he would have liked it to be. He already had
a lot of reviews on google reviews and had won an award for customer service, but he wanted that professionalism to be reflected on the website as well. The ask was to make
flashy with a lot of animations and for it to look different from most websites out there. 

The requirements:
1. Landing page - Needs to be eye catching and include promo for taps
2. Contact us page and form
3. Services page - showcasing all the work he had to offer (which was more than just plumbing)
4. Certificates and Awards section
5. Gallery page - showcasing some of his work
6. Customer Reviews page
7. Web responsive design
